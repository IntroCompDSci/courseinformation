# :wave: Student Information on Two New Data Science Courses offered by [UofT FAS](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca)

:book: [EEB125H1S: Introductory Computation and Data Science for the Life and Physical Sciences](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/eeb125h1)

:book: [GGR274H1S: Introductory Computation and Data Science for the Social Sciences](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ggr274h1)

## Why is it Important to Study Computation and Data Science?

:point_right: Data and the tools of data science are increasingly woven into our daily lives, including mapping relationships via social media, capturing individuals’ speech and action via sensors, tracking movement across space, shaping police and security policy via “predictive policing,” analyzing genomes to improve decisions in fields such as conservation and agriculture, identifying health risks and outcomes from patient data, and much more.  

## What introductory computation and  data science courses are available for UofT students interested in studying Life/Physical Science or Social Sciences? 

:point_right: Science and social science students who want to apply Computation and Data Science knowledge and skills to their studies are now able to enroll in exciting, new interdisciplinary foundational Data Science courses￼￼￼￼: EEB125H1 (for students in the Physical and Life Sciences), and GGR274H1 (for students in the Social Sciences) that will be offered for the first time in Winter 2022.

## Do I need to own a laptop computer or know how to install complicated software to be successful in the course?

:point_right: No.  You don’t need your own laptop, but it may be more convenient.  You won’t have to install any software or need a fancy computer to be able to fully participate.  

## What is the difference between GGR274 and EEB125?

:point_right: The same core Data Science content are covered in both courses, but each is tailored to students through a combination of scientific or social sciences applications and themes.  

## Is EEB125/GGR274 a computer science class, a statistics class, a biology/geography class or something else?

:point_right: This is a data science course, not a computer science or statistics course, so scientific and social science questions will be front and centre, yet you will be learning how to answer questions and communicate answers using data.  This process involves writing computer programs in Python to implement data science tools and be able to understand how to interpret and communicate statistical information. 
Both courses will weave together disciplines and their implications in a powerful and interesting way.  Some of these topics are quite different from what appears in a typical introductory course from either computer science or statistics. Both courses will be co-taught by a team of disciplinary experts in social sciences and sciences, computer science, and statistical sciences.  

## Does EEB125/GGR274 have prerequisites?
:point_right: No. The course is designed for students who are new to statistics and programming, although students with experience in one or the other may still learn a lot.
Which breadth requirement does EEB125/GGR274 satisfy?
The Physical and Mathematical Universes (5)

## Does EEB125/GGR274 depend on a previous background in statistics or computer programming?
:point_right: No. EEB125/GGR274 teaches statistics and computer programming differently from most high school or university courses.

## What programming language is EEB125/GGR274 taught in?
:point_right: [Python](https://www.python.org).

## If I want more background in programming or statistics, can I take another course as well?
:point_right: Yes.  A great introduction to computer programming is CSC108, or CSC148 if you have some programming experience.  There are several courses at UofT that offer an introduction to statistics including: GGR270, STA220, STA130, STA288, ECO220, EEB225.

## Who will teach these courses in Winter 2022? 
:point_right: The courses are developed and taught by an interdisciplinary team of faculty.  Professors [Paul Gries](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Epgries/) (Computer Science), [Caroline Parins-Fukuchi](https://carolinetomo.github.io) (EEB125), [Nathan Taback](https://utstat.toronto.edu/nathan/) (Statistical Sciences/Computer Science), and [Michael Widener](https://geography.utoronto.ca/profiles/michael-widener/) (GGR274).

## Why is EEB125H1 a 100-level course and the GGR274 200-level course? 
:point_right: The 100-/200-level designators are signals, not rules: these courses do not have prerequisites, and can be taken by students from any year of study. 
In the Life and Physical Sciences, students usually have more room in their first-year schedules than in second-year or upper years.   In the Social Sciences, students usually start studying quantitative aspects of their disciplines after having a year of broad study.

## When will a syllabus and more information be available?

:point_right: Fall 2021.
